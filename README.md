# Whiteboardclock

A group of coworkers exploring IoT/Maker/eletronics. Uses the Particle Photon microcontroller.

## What does it do?

A robot with two moving arms that directs a whiteboard marker around. Each arm is controlled by a servo, a third servo is used to lift the platform part that holds the arms.

## Current challanges

Servos are bad! or rather, not so very precise in the lower price ranges. TODO, implement offset for center and factor for correcting angles.

## Materials used

* Particle Photon
* Three servos
* Bunch of wires
* Wood, to make platform
* Magnets, to keep platform to whiteboard
* Hinge, to allow "pen up"
* Lego, to build arms
